    "text": "My name is Talia C. Swanson, and I am currently a second-year Master of Public Health (MPH) student in the Epidemiology concentration. I completed my Bachelor of Science in Biology at the University of Georgia this past Summer and am originally from Atlanta, Georgia.\nMy interest in public health grew through my work IMPACT UGA Alternative Service Breaks, a program that sends students to cities across the Southeast to explore socioeconomic challenges and contribute to intiatives supporting these communities. I participated in trips to Asheboro, NC, focusing on affordable housing, and Charlotte, NC, focusing on education access."

    "text": "Research Interests & Goals\nMy research interests focus on environmental exposures, specifically particulate matter, PM2.5, and how these expsoures contribute to the development of chronic disease. I am also interested in social determinants of health, with an emphasis on how cultural choices and structures influence health outcomes. Currently, I am supporting a Household Air Pollution Intervention Network, (HAPIN), follow-up study examining the effects of PM2.5 exposure from traditional cooking methods on the human microbiome and its relationship to respiratory health.\nIn addition to my epidemiologic interests, I currently support a project in the ACCESS Lab within the Cellular Biology department that examines undergraduate experiences in STEM, with a focus on how institutional structures and learning environments shape student engagement.\nLong term, I hope to study environmental exposures and how they contribute to respiratory and nuerodegenerative disease while pursuing a career in the federal sector."

    "text": "Data Analysis Experience\nI have taken EPID 7010 and BIOS 7010/7020 that focused on using SAS and Stata to produce survivial models, regression, ANOVA, and T-tests for statistical analysis. Additionally, I have worked on an independet project assessing major depressive episodes in adolescents aged 12-17, examining the factors of culture and racial demographics for multivariate regression modeling using R. For this class, I hope to build on my software and coding skills to become more confident in analyzing data as I hope to incorporate coding into my future career."

I also enjoy reading in my spare time, particularly fantasy and myth-based genres involving vampires, elves, warlocks, and related themes. I enjoy exploring new foods and recently Pad Thai for the very first time during my study abroad trip to Bangkok!\n\n  \n\nI also included this link to an introduction to spatial statistics using GIS (Geographic Information Systems). I really hope to somehow get into using spatial analysis/I find it interesting! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmWS_gSrCbk"
