We have two specific relationships of interest.\n\nLife expectancy vs. infant mortality\nLife expectancy vs. population\n\n\n\n\nPlot Life Expectancy vs Infant Mortality\n\nggplot(africadata, aes(x = infant_mortality, y = life_expectancy)) +\n  geom_point() +   # scatter plot points\n  labs(title = \"Life Expectancy vs Infant Mortality (Africa)\",\n       x = \"Infant Mortality\",\n       y = \"Life Expectancy\") +\n  theme_minimal()  # clean visual style\n\nWarning: Removed 226 rows containing missing values or values outside the scale range\n(`geom_point()`).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis allows us to generate a scatterplot to show the relationship between life expectancy and infant morality in African countries.\n\n\n\nPlot Life Expectancy vs Population\n\nggplot(africadata, aes(x = population, y = life_expectancy)) +\n  geom_point() +               # scatter plot points\n  scale_x_log10() +            # log-scale for population\n  labs(title = \"Life Expectancy vs Population (Africa, log scale)\",\n       x = \"Population\",\n       y = \"Life Expectancy\") +\n  theme_minimal()              # clean visual style\n\nWarning: Removed 51 rows containing missing values or values outside the scale range\n(`geom_point()`).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow we can examine the relaionshio between population size and life expectancy. However, we log-scale the x-axia, ‘x’, due to population variability. This scaling will improve the readability of our graph visual.\n\n\n\nFocus on the Year 2000\n\nyear2000 &lt;- africadata[africadata$year == 2000, ]\nstr(year2000)\n\n'data.frame':   51 obs. of  9 variables:\n $ country         : Factor w/ 185 levels \"Albania\",\"Algeria\",..: 2 3 18 22 26 27 29 31 32 33 ...\n $ year            : int  2000 2000 2000 2000 2000 2000 2000 2000 2000 2000 ...\n $ infant_mortality: num  33.9 128.3 89.3 52.4 96.2 ...\n $ life_expectancy : num  73.3 52.3 57.2 47.6 52.6 46.7 54.3 68.4 45.3 51.5 ...\n $ fertility       : num  2.51 6.84 5.98 3.41 6.59 7.06 5.62 3.7 5.45 7.35 ...\n $ population      : num  31183658 15058638 6949366 1736579 11607944 ...\n $ gdp             : num  5.48e+10 9.13e+09 2.25e+09 5.63e+09 2.61e+09 ...\n $ continent       : Factor w/ 5 levels \"Africa\",\"Americas\",..: 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ...\n $ region          : Factor w/ 22 levels \"Australia and New Zealand\",..: 11 10 20 17 20 5 10 20 10 10 ...\n\nsummary(year2000)\n\n         country        year      infant_mortality life_expectancy\n Algeria     : 1   Min.   :2000   Min.   : 12.30   Min.   :37.60  \n Angola      : 1   1st Qu.:2000   1st Qu.: 60.80   1st Qu.:51.75  \n Benin       : 1   Median :2000   Median : 80.30   Median :54.30  \n Botswana    : 1   Mean   :2000   Mean   : 78.93   Mean   :56.36  \n Burkina Faso: 1   3rd Qu.:2000   3rd Qu.:103.30   3rd Qu.:60.00  \n Burundi     : 1   Max.   :2000   Max.   :143.30   Max.   :75.00  \n (Other)     :45                                                  \n   fertility       population             gdp               continent \n Min.   :1.990   Min.   :    81154   Min.   :2.019e+08   Africa  :51  \n 1st Qu.:4.150   1st Qu.:  2304687   1st Qu.:1.274e+09   Americas: 0  \n Median :5.550   Median :  8799165   Median :3.238e+09   Asia    : 0  \n Mean   :5.156   Mean   : 15659800   Mean   :1.155e+10   Europe  : 0  \n 3rd Qu.:5.960   3rd Qu.: 17391242   3rd Qu.:8.654e+09   Oceania : 0  \n Max.   :7.730   Max.   :122876723   Max.   :1.329e+11                \n                                                                      \n                       region  \n Eastern Africa           :16  \n Western Africa           :16  \n Middle Africa            : 8  \n Northern Africa          : 6  \n Southern Africa          : 5  \n Australia and New Zealand: 0  \n (Other)                  : 0  \n\n\nSome data years have inconsistent data or missing data.

I completed my Bachelor of Science in Biology at the University of Georgia this past Summer and am originally from Atlanta, Georgia.\nMy interest in public health grew through my work with IMPACT UGA Alternative Service Breaks, a program that sends students to cities across the Southeast to explore socioeconomic challenges and contribute to initiatives supporting these communities. I participated in trips to Asheboro, NC, focusing on affordable housing, and Charlotte, NC, focusing on education access."

    "text": "Research Interests & Goals\nMy research interests focus on environmental exposures, specifically particulate matter, PM2.5, and how these exposures contribute to the development of chronic disease. I am also interested in social determinants of health, with an emphasis on how cultural choices and structures influence health outcomes. Currently, I am supporting a Household Air Pollution Intervention Network, (HAPIN), follow-up study examining the effects of PM2.5 exposure from traditional cooking methods on the human microbiome and its relationship to respiratory health.\nIn addition to my epidemiologic interests, I currently support a project in the ACCESS Lab within the Cellular Biology department that examines undergraduate experiences in STEM, with a focus on how institutional structures and learning environments shape student engagement.\nLong term, I hope to study environmental exposures and how they contribute to respiratory and nuerodegenerative disease while pursuing a career in the federal sector."

    "text": "Research Interests & Goals\nMy research interests focus on environmental exposures, specifically particulate matter, PM2.5, and how these expsoures contribute to the development of chronic disease. I am also interested in social determinants of health, with an emphasis on how cultural choices and structures influence health outcomes. Currently, I am supporting a Household Air Pollution Intervention Network, (HAPIN), follow-up study examining the effects of PM2.5 exposure from traditional cooking methods on the human microbiome and its relationship to respiratory health.\nIn addition to my epidemiologic interests, I currently support a project in the ACCESS Lab within the Cellular Biology department that examines undergraduate experiences in STEM, with a focus on how institutional structures and learning environments shape student engagement.\nLong term, I hope to study environmental exposures and how they contribute to respiratory and nuerodegenerative disease while pursuing a career in the federal sector."

    "text": "Data Analysis Experience\nI have taken EPID 7010 and BIOS 7010/7020 that focused on using SAS and Stata to produce survivial models, regression, ANOVA, and T-tests for statistical analysis. Additionally, I have worked on an independet project assessing major depressive episodes in adolescents aged 12-17, examining the factors of culture and racial demographics for multivariate regression modeling using R. For this class, I hope to build on my software and coding skills to become more confident in analyzing data as I hope to incorporate coding into my future career."
